# Post Forwarder Telegram Bot

## About

A [telegram bot](https://core.telegram.org/bots) that forwards a message posted on one or more groups or channels to other list of groups or channels with a control over the when and the how often and so on.
It was done for a private client.

## Using it on a self-hosted server

- Step 1: First you need to have a Telegram bot API token to communicate to the Telgram bot API. [Here](https://core.telegram.org/bots/tutorial#obtain-your-bot-token) is how you can obtain your API token.
- Step 2: Replace the value of the variable `BOT_TOKEN_API` in the file `bot.py` with the bot API token you have obtained in step 1.
